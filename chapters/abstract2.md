Conjugated polymer has many applications in the semiconductor industry: Polymer
Light-Emitting Diodes, Polymer Field-Effect Transistor and Polymer Solar Cell. There
are tremendous attention paid to the research on polymer solar cell as people are
getting more aware of environment protection as well as the comprehension of
developing new kind of energy. This thesis focues on two highly discussed aspects
based on the research of Alan Heeger's group:
(1) Charge generation, or excition formation process; (2) Charge transport, or
dynamics of charge carrier motion in conjuatged polymer system.


Molecule dynamics is empolyed to uncover the time profile of exciton formation,
which can be divided into two stages: the localization of electron-hole pairs and
the relaxation process. Under photoexcitation, the electron transition rapidly forms
the electron-hole pair which also leads to its localization, which triggers the
total energy to shift violently and oscillate. The oscillation during the first 40
fs induces the excitation to step into the second stage, i.e., relaxation. After the
relaxation process of about 850 fs, the total energy , lattice energy and electron
energy reach certain values while the lattice configuration and electron eremain
localized, and indicating the formation of a singlet exciton. Because electron-hole
pair is localized before exciton is formed, it is highly likely that the
electron-hole pair will be separated before the formation of exciton in the process
of conducting polymeric solar cell. The corresponding result has been published on
*Journal of Physical Chemistry B*.

In a real bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell, after exciton separation in the
heterojunction,the resulting negatively-charged  carrier, a polaron, moves along the
chain of the acceptor, which is believed to be of significance for the charged
carrier transport properties in a polymer solar cell. During the negative polaron
transport, due to the external light field, the polaron is re-excited and induces
deep localization, also forming a new local distortion of the alternating bonds. It
is revealed that the excited polaron moves more slowly than the ground-state
polaron. Furthermore, the velocity of the polaron moving along the polymer chain is
crucially dependent on the photoexcitation. With an increase in the instensity of
the optical filed, the localization of the excited polaron has been deepning, with a
slowing down of the polaronâ€™s velocity. Mostly, the deep trapping effect of charged
carrier in composite conjugated polymer solar cell presents an opportunity for the
future application in nanoscale memory and imaging devices. The corresponding result
has been published on *Nanoscale*.
